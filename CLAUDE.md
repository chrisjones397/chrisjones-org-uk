# Notes for Claude: chrisjones.org.uk

Christopher's site: hand-written HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no framework and no build step on Cloudflare.
The README covers the workflow for people; this file adds what a new Claude session needs.
Always: British English; links are never underlined; give Christopher the commands so he can do things himself.

## Branches and hosting

- **dev** is where all work happens; it is published at dev.chrisjones.org.uk (with noindex).
- **main** is live, chrisjones.org.uk. It only ever moves by fast-forwarding to dev, after Christopher approves.
- **painted-forest-tools** holds the scripts that made the opening video. Never merged, never published.
- Cloudflare: two Workers build from this repository. chrisjones397-github-io builds main (`npx wrangler deploy`);
  chrisjones397-github-io-dev builds dev (`npx wrangler deploy --env dev`). Settings in wrangler.jsonc;
  `.assetsignore` lists what isn't published (this file, the README, tools/, masters/, paintings.yaml...).

## Who does what

- Claude works in a cloud clone of the repository: edits, runs `python3 tools/build_site.py` (needs Pillow and
  PyYAML: `pip install --break-system-packages pillow pyyaml`), commits and pushes to dev. Christopher reviews on
  dev.chrisjones.org.uk and says when to put it live.
- Christopher works on his Mac in /Library/WebServer/Documents/prd/sync (a clone on dev, served by local Apache,
  Python in a venv there). He pushes some things himself (e.g. new master images), and prefers not to run
  build_site.py locally until he has checked it; he asks Claude to run it.

## Starting a session (both sides must be in sync with GitHub)

Claude, before any change:

    git clone https://github.com/chrisjones397/chrisjones397.github.io && cd chrisjones397.github.io
    git checkout dev && git pull --rebase       # (in an existing clone: git checkout dev && git pull --rebase)

Christopher, on the Mac before working, and again before pushing anything (Claude may have pushed meanwhile):

    cd /Library/WebServer/Documents/prd/sync
    git checkout dev
    git status                  # anything uncommitted? commit it (or git stash) first
    git pull --rebase           # bring in what Claude pushed; his own unpushed commits go on top

If `git pull --rebase` stops with a conflict, stop and ask rather than guess. Generated files (index.html's
built blocks, paintings/, gallery/, img/, 404.html) can always be remade by running build_site.py.

Claude, before pushing: `git pull --rebase` too, then rebuild if paintings.yaml or masters changed.

## Putting dev live (only when Christopher says so)

    git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git merge --ff-only dev && git push && git checkout dev

`--ff-only` refuses if main has anything dev doesn't: stop and look if it does.

## How the site is made

- **tools/build_site.py** reads paintings.yaml and masters/ and writes: every image size in img/ (WebP), each
  painting's page in paintings/<name>/, gallery/ (floating gallery page), gallery/list/, 404.html, and the
  built blocks inside index.html (between `<!-- ... start/end -->` markers: contact picture, gallery
  section). It copies index.html's `<style>` and header into every other page, so shared styles live in
  index.html. It fingerprints local script addresses (`?v=<hash>`) so browsers never run stale scripts.
  Never edit generated files by hand; change index.html, the script or paintings.yaml and rebuild.
- **paintings.yaml**: sections and paintings (title, details "Medium, H x W cm, year", wide), plus
  `contact_picture:`, `gallery_invitation:` (paintings shown before the 3D gallery loads) and `gallery:` settings.
  Master file names come from titles: `python3 tools/build_site.py --name "Title"`.
- **Home page order**: opening forest video (.hero) / gallery section (#paintings, .invite) / contact
  (#contact) / profile with the head animation (.face-section, three windows tall) / footer (copyright only).
- **motion.js**: title drift and profile text spring; parallax; and directional snapping (after a scroll rests,
  glide on to the next resting place in the direction of travel, never back; free inside the profile; any
  wheel/touch/key cancels). Christopher's principle: work with the visitor, never against them.
- **gallery/gallery.js** (Three.js, vendored in face/vendor/): the floating gallery. Full-window on its own page;
  on the home page a section (data-mode="section") that hangs still until "Enter Gallery", then fills the
  window until "Exit Gallery" / Escape. The view is remembered for the visit (sessionStorage).
- **face/face.js**: the head animation, driven by scrolling through .face-section; pauses while off screen.
- **glass.js**: the header's thick-glass look over the opening video or the gallery page's canvas.

## Testing

Christopher's usage matters, and the cloud browser has no graphics card (3D and video are very slow there).
For small changes (wording, colours, positions): build, push, and let him check on dev. Run browser tests only
when behaviour changes (snapping, gallery switching), keep screenshots to layout questions, and say what was
and wasn't tested.
